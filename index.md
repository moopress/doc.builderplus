# Prerequisites

Before you get started creating your site using **LawyerPlus**, you'll need to **setup your WordPress environment**. LawyerPlus requires *WordPress v4.1* or greater. For more information on setting up you WordPress environment please refer to [WordPress Codex "Installing WordPress" entry](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress). If you're experiencing difficulty setting up you WordPress install, you'll need to contact your **hosting company** or your **local system administrator**.

## PHP Configuration
If your server is running PHP `v5.6`, you will need to specify `always_populate_raw_post_data = -1` in your `php.ini` file and reload your web server. This addresses a known bug with the default PHP `v5.6` configuration. For more information on this issue, please see [this blog post](https://www.bram.us/2014/10/26/php-5-6-automatically-populating-http_raw_post_data-is-deprecated-and-will-be-removed-in-a-future-version/). If you find yourself unable to modify your `php.ini` file, please contact your hosting service or site manager.

#Modifying The Theme
Direct code modifications of LawyerPlus are highly discouraged. The recommended way of making modifications to the theme are through the usage of a Child Theme.

## Child Theme
If you are unfamiliar with the concept of a child theme, please refer to the [WordPress Codex entry on Child Themes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes). PHP & CSS edits should be made through a child theme. A template child theme is included in the theme package (downloaded from ThemeForest) inside the `resources` directory of the unpacked package.

**Note:** WordPress stores theme customizations on a theme by theme basis. If you've made used the one-click demo or edited the theme customization options with LawyerPlus as your theme instead of your child theme, you will need to export and import your customizations using the [Customizer Import/Export plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).

# Miscellaneous

## Permalink Settings

The recommended permalink setting for use with LawyerPlus is the `Post name` default setting in the `Settings > Permalinks` page in the admin dashboard.

## Translation

LawyerPlus supports [Translation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress) through conventional WordPress translation method. For the translation template for the theme see the theme directory `lawyerplus\lang\lawyerplus.pot`.
