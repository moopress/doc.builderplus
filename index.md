#Modifying The Theme
Direct code modifications of MedicalPlus are highly discouraged. The recommended way of making modifications to the theme are through the usage of a Child Theme.

## Child Theme
If you are unfamiliar with the concept of a child theme, please refer to the [WordPress Codex entry on Child Themes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes). PHP & CSS edits should be made through a child theme. A template child theme is included in the theme package (downloaded from ThemeForest) inside the `resources` directory of the unpacked package.

**Note:** WordPress stores theme customizations on a theme by theme basis. If you've made used the one-click demo or edited the theme customization options with MedicalPlus as your theme instead of your child theme, you will need to export and import your customizations using the [Customizer Import/Export plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).

# Miscellaneous

## Permalink Settings

The recommended permalink setting for use with MedicalPlus is the `Post name` default setting in the `Settings > Permalinks` page in the admin dashboard.

Zebu supports [Translation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress) through conventional WordPress translation method. For the translation template for the theme see the theme directory `medicalplus\lang\medicalplus.pot`.
